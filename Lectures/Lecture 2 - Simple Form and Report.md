#### **Topic 1: How to Create a Simple Form**

1. **Introduction to Forms in Microsoft Access**
   - **What is a Form?:**  
     A form in Microsoft Access is a user-friendly interface for entering, viewing, or editing data stored in tables. Forms are especially useful when dealing with larger or more complex tables by simplifying data entry and navigation.
   - **Why Use Forms?:**  
     Forms provide an intuitive way for users to interact with the database without needing direct access to tables. They can also be customized to include drop-down lists, buttons, and other controls to streamline data input.

2. **Understanding Form Types**
   - **Single Form:**  
     A form that shows information for one record at a time. This type of form is ideal for focused data entry or review.
   - **Continuous Form:**  
     A form that displays multiple records in a list format, similar to a datasheet, but with enhanced design options.
   - **Split Form:**  
     Combines a Single Form and Datasheet View, allowing users to view a list of records in the bottom pane while editing details of the selected record in the top pane.
   - **Multiple Item Forms:**  
     A form that shows multiple records in a more customizable format than a datasheet.

3. **Creating a Simple Form Using the Form Wizard**
   - **Step 1: Choosing the Table/Query for Your Form:**  
     Explain how to choose the table or query from which the form will pull data. This table will be the data source for the form.
   - **Step 2: Selecting Fields to Display in the Form:**  
     Discuss how to choose which fields will appear on the form (e.g., only the essential fields such as "Name," "Date of Birth," and "Phone Number").
   - **Step 3: Form Layout Options (Columnar, Tabular, etc.):**  
     Provide an overview of different layout options and their impact on form appearance. Columnar forms display fields vertically, while tabular forms display them horizontally.
   - **Step 4: Applying Themes and Formatting:**  
     Explain how to use Access themes to customize the look and feel of the form, including colors, fonts, and styles to improve user experience.
   - **Step 5: Saving and Naming the Form:**  
     Best practices for saving forms in the database, naming them properly, and ensuring easy access.

4. **Working with the Form Design View**
   - **Customizing the Layout:**  
     Introduction to the Form Design View, where you can fine-tune the layout, adjust field placements, and add additional controls (buttons, combo boxes, etc.).
   - **Adding Controls (Text Boxes, Combo Boxes, etc.):**  
     Step-by-step guide on how to add different types of form controls like text boxes for data entry, combo boxes for predefined options, and buttons for form navigation.
   - **Setting Tab Order for Easy Navigation:**  
     How to set the tab order, which determines the sequence in which the cursor moves through the fields when pressing the "Tab" key.
   - **Formatting Forms (Labels, Fonts, Colors):**  
     Discuss how to use Access' formatting options to enhance form readability and usability by changing labels, fonts, colors, and overall design.

5. **Exercise: Creating a Simple Data Entry Form**
   - **Step-by-Step Example of Creating a Form:**  
     Students will create a form based on a "Customers" table, selecting fields like "First Name," "Last Name," "Phone Number," and "Email." They will also format the form using the design tools.

#### **Topic 2: What is a Report and How to Get It from Your Database**

1. **Introduction to Reports in Microsoft Access**
   - **What is a Report?:**  
     A report in Access is a formatted printout or on-screen display of data from a database. Reports are often used to summarize data, present it professionally, and make it easy to share with others.
   - **Why Use Reports?:**  
     Reports are essential for presenting data in a structured way for decision-making, audits, or analysis. They allow for advanced formatting, grouping, and data visualization (e.g., charts and summary fields).

2. **Report Types in Microsoft Access**
   - **Basic Reports:**  
     Simple reports generated from tables or queries that list data in a predefined format.
   - **Summary Reports:**  
     Reports that group data and calculate totals, averages, counts, or other aggregate statistics based on certain criteria.
   - **Label Reports:**  
     Reports designed to generate mailing labels or other label formats for business or personal use.
   - **Chart Reports:**  
     Visual reports that include charts or graphs based on data in your tables/queries, useful for data analysis and presentations.

3. **How to Create a Simple Report Using the Report Wizard**
   - **Step 1: Choosing the Table/Query for Your Report:**  
     Similar to creating a form, start by selecting the source table or query that contains the data you want to display in the report.
   - **Step 2: Selecting Fields to Display in the Report:**  
     Explain how to choose the fields you want to include, such as "Sales Amount," "Customer Name," and "Date."
   - **Step 3: Grouping and Sorting Data:**  
     Discuss the option to group data by specific fields (e.g., grouping by "Region" or "Category") and how to apply sorting (e.g., by date or name) to organize the data logically.
   - **Step 4: Choosing Layout and Report Style (Stepped, Block, etc.):**  
     Explain different layout styles, such as Stepped (hierarchical presentation) or Block (data arranged in a table-like format). Each style offers varying levels of data readability.
   - **Step 5: Previewing the Report:**  
     Show how to preview a report to check its format and data before finalizing. Discuss how to make adjustments if necessary.
   - **Step 6: Saving and Naming the Report:**  
     Best practices for naming and saving reports, ensuring easy identification and access for future use.

4. **Formatting Reports and Adding Calculations**
   - **Customizing Report Layout in Design View:**  
     Explore the Report Design View, where users can fine-tune layout elements, such as positioning fields, headers, footers, and labels.
   - **Adding Group Headers and Footers:**  
     Learn how to insert group headers or footers to organize data, making it easier to understand. This is often used in summary reports to separate different categories.
   - **Inserting Calculations and Totals:**  
     Step-by-step instructions on how to add calculated fields, such as sums, averages, or percentages. For example, calculating total sales in a "Sales Report."
   - **Adding Charts to Reports:**  
     Introduction to integrating charts (bar, line, pie) in reports to visually represent data trends or distributions.
   - **Formatting Reports (Fonts, Colors, Borders):**  
     Discuss how to apply formatting to reports to improve their readability, professionalism, and visual appeal. This includes font adjustments, color schemes, and borders.

5. **Printing, Exporting, and Sharing Reports**
   - **Previewing Before Printing:**  
     Explain the importance of checking a reportâ€™s layout in Print Preview to ensure it fits on the page properly and displays all necessary data.
   - **Exporting Reports to PDF or Excel:**  
     Show how to export reports into different formats such as PDF or Excel, allowing for easy sharing and further data manipulation.
   - **Sharing Reports via Email:**  
     How to directly send reports to stakeholders via email as an attachment.

6. **Exercise: Creating a Simple Report**
   - **Step-by-Step Example of Building a Report:**  
     Students will create a report based on a "Sales" table. The report will group sales data by region and include a calculated field to show total sales per region. Additionally, they will apply formatting and export the report as a PDF.
